# Problem Statement

To design an electronic pen that stores the text (that is physically written on a surface) automatically in a storage device. This text could be later edited based on our needs. This device should have some sort of correction techniques to rectifiy any mistakes made previously. The size of the device must be reasonably small(diameter< 15 mm). The device should be able to collect data from different types of surfaces.  

Preferable Addition:
A live transfer of data to be viewed/edited via Bluetooth connection to an PC/Mobile application. This reduces the additional developments required to make it possible to do corrections and makes it significantly easier.  

# Different Ideations

## Different sensors

### Using IMU sensor coupled with Pressure Sensors, GPS sensors
### CMOS sensor with LED as Source light
### IR sources of different frequencies and a device to receive the reflected data  

My thought on this:
Replicating the functions of mouse in a pen is very difficult because of the size constraints. If it is feasible, this would be the best method. Implementing IMU sensor is simple, but it required additional components like GPS module. IMU sensors are considerably small too.
