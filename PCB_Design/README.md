# PCB Design with Eagle
Project Task 1 was meant to introduce us into the world of PCB design. 
## Video 1:
Introduction in Schematics    
1. Creating schematics file in Eagle
2. Adding Libraries  
3. Adding, deleting, moving components of the circuit  
4. Completing the circuit by joining different components

## Video 2:
Converting schematics into Circuit boards  
1. Creating a .brd file for the .sch file
2. Adding the components onto the circuit board area and using RATSNEST to optimise connections
3. Grounding the Top and Bottom layers for the purpose of cooling and acting as a ground for connections  
4. Manual/Auto routing of connections to form the circuit board 

## Video 3:
Circuit Manufacturing  
Exporting the circuit into gerber files for manufacturing
